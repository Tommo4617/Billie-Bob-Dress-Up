# Billie-Bob-Dress-Up
A small project allowing the user to cycle through different outfits for a clown.

## Objective
To pracice some CSS and HTML by creating a simple interactive game.

## What I learnt
Throughout the project I learnt how to design my own elements to be used in a Blazor project, alongside how to alter the layout of elements on a page by using different divisions.

## Next steps
Create a project that has custom design elements, but also allows for the design to scale to different screen sizes.
